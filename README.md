# Covid19 SA Data
Website to show data visualisations pertaining to current coronavirus outbreak in South Africa.

Note: This is **very** much a work in progress. Jupyter notebook code is going to be consolidated into a single python file so that the graphs do not need to be recreated via the Jupyter notebooks each time.
